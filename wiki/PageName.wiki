#summary About scard2ppk

= Introduction =

When using SmartCards for pubkey-based SSH authentication with <a href="http://www.opensc-project.org/opensc/wiki/PuTTYcard">OpenSC/PuTTYcard</a>, a complex procedure is used for extracting the necessary information from the SmartCard to create the reference .ppk file that can be used by the modified Pageant.exe.

These scripts do exactly this process: they analyse the contents of your SmartCard and create `SC_*.ppk` files ready for use.


= Details =

There are three kind of entities on the SmartCard: certificates, private keys and pin codes. (Certainly, neither the private keys nor the pin codes can be extracted from the card, they can only be referred to.)

The certificates consist of three parts: a public key, some additional information (about the issuer, the subject, the validity, etc.) and a digital signature from an authority.

For pubkey-based SSH authentication we will therefore need:
  * the ID of a certificate on the card
  * the ID if the private key whose public key is embedded in the certificate
  * the ID of the pin code that protects the private key

The already mentioned PuTTYcard tool is a Pageant replacement that can use -in addition to private key files- SmartCards as well, provided that we supply it the IDs to use in a specifically formatted .ppk file.

These scripts generate such .ppk files, following the steps described on the OpenSC page.


= Requirements =

To use these scripts you will need:
  * <a href="http://www.opensc-project.org/opensc/wiki/DownloadRelease#x86WindowsInstaller">OpenSC</a> for Windows
  * <a href="http://www.openssl.org/related/binaries.html">OpenSSL</a> for Windows
  * <a href="http://www.opensc-project.org/files/contrib/PuTTYcard-0.58-V1.2.zip">PuTTYcard</a>

If you plan to use not just PuTTY/PSCP/Plink, but Cygwin-based OpenSSH as well, then you may also find useful:
